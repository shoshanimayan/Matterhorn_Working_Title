                    I’m a rad dude with lots of attitude. 
                    Are you a bad enough dude to collect trash?  
                    Let’s go on a rad quest to collect trash and 
                    machine parts to find out! Fight enemies!

                    Likes: I love corn dogs and road trips across middle America </br>
                    Dislikes: uncool things, homework, textbooks, school, 
                    your mom telling you to clean your room

                    Forager Rabbits are huge babies! Every time 
                    I get near one of these identical siblings 
                    they start running away! They’re pretty lame 
                    and not at all tubular, but they’re always 
                    holding some goodies on em, beat them up! 
                    Take their stuff!</br> </br>
                    Likes: their mommy because they’re all huge babies! </br>
                    Dislikes: hanging out with cool raccoons like me. Their loss

                <p>
                    Craig is a wiley jerk! This sneaky son 
                    of a gun always wants to get into a fight! 
                    He’s still angry about that time I stole 
                    all his food and he had to starve all winter, 
                    let it go dude. If he sees you, he’ll rush at 
                    you and try to beat you up! Luckily this doggo 
                    is more bark than bite, and he doesn’t put up 
                    much of a fight, and you can beat him up for his lunch.</br> </br>
                    Likes: picking fights, being a jerk, chasing birds, 
                    being a jerk, Led Zeppelin, AND BEING A JERK. </br>
                    Dislikes: being told he’s a jerk, having his stuff stolen I guess, losing.

            <h3>Mob Moles</h3>
            <div class="row form-group">
              <div class="col-lg-3">
                <img class="largerArt" src="">
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-9">
                <p>
                    These guys are mobsters I guess? They say they’re all 
                    in the mafia, but I’ve never really see them do anything 
                    until recently, and it kinda feels like they just watch 
                    to many movies. I guess their boss is upset with me or 
                    something, and they’ve been trying to pick a fight with 
                    me, lame. Despite being blind, these moles have weirdly 
                    good aim, and they’ll use it to throw balls of mud 
                    (I hope its mud at least) at you, and they’ll hide 
                    underground where you can’t hit them.</br> </br>
                    Likes: Mob movies, talking in a fake mobster voice, 
                    Chicago Style Gangster Accents, tea.</br>
                    Dislikes:  being made fun off, getting beat up, being told 
                    to stop hanging out in the dirt, taking baths.
