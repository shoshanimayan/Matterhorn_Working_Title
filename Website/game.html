                  Collect 60 mechanical pieces, either lying around, 
                  or in trash cans or recycling bins. Once you’ve got

                  and touch it to complete it.

                  It’s been months since this college was deserted by humans. 
                  And no humans means no Trash! And no trash means no food for 
                  the Racoon family! With only a short time left before all the 
                  baby raccoons die of starvation, our survival depends on our 
                  trash generator invention, The Turbo Infinite Trash-omatic, 
                  which will give us all the trash we could ever want. Therefore, 
                  you and I, Roddie Racoon, must venture forth onto a rad quest 
                  to collect all the mechanical parts we need. But watch out!, 
                  the area is full of rude dudes who want to beat me up for 
                  alleged crimes no one can prove I committed. Are you a bad 
                  enough dude to go dumpster diving?

                    Are you a bad enough dude to collect trash?  
                    Let’s go on a rad quest to collect trash and

                    Forager Rabbits are huge babies! Every time 
                    I get near one of these identical siblings 
                    they start running away! They’re pretty lame 
                    and not at all tubular, but they’re always 
                    holding some goodies on em, beat them up! 
                    Take their stuff!</br> </br>
                    Likes: their mommy because they’re all huge babies! </br>

                    Craig is a wiley jerk! This sneaky son 
                    of a gun always wants to get into a fight! 
                    He’s still angry about that time I stole 
                    all his food and he had to starve all winter, 
                    let it go dude. If he sees you, he’ll rush at 
                    you and try to beat you up! Luckily this doggo 
                    is more bark than bite, and he doesn’t put up 
                    much of a fight, and you can beat him up for his lunch.</br> </br>
                    Likes: picking fights, being a jerk, chasing birds, 
                    being a jerk, Led Zeppelin, AND BEING A JERK. </br>
                    Dislikes: being told he’s a jerk, having his stuff stolen I guess, losing.

                <p>
                    These guys are mobsters I guess? They say they’re all 
                    in the mafia, but I’ve never really see them do anything 
                    until recently, and it kinda feels like they just watch 
                    to many movies. I guess their boss is upset with me or 
                    something, and they’ve been trying to pick a fight with 
                    me, lame. Despite being blind, these moles have weirdly 
                    good aim, and they’ll use it to throw balls of mud 
                    (I hope its mud at least) at you, and they’ll hide 
                    underground where you can’t hit them.</br> </br>
                    Likes: Mob movies, talking in a fake mobster voice, 
                    Chicago Style Gangster Accents, tea.</br>
                    Dislikes:  being made fun off, getting beat up, being told 
                    to stop hanging out in the dirt, taking baths.

                <p>
                  Never ask a Mobster Mole for a loan as seed money for your 
                  trash machine. He starts bothering you about when your gonna 
                  come over and hang out, or pay him back his money, or give 
                  back all his stuff. He just doesn’t get it, I’m a very busy 
                  guy with important things to do, I don't have time to mess 
                  around and play video games like some sort of loser. This 
                  guy is just a huge nerd, literally, he’s a really big dude 
                  and packs a punch, throwing multiple balls of mud at you at 
                  once. I’m pretty sure the other moles made him the boss because 
                  he’s so big, but honestly he’s kind of a pushover, but maybe he’s 
                  got more cool nerd stuff we can borrow if we beat him up.</br> </br>
                  Likes: Video games, anime, nerd stuff i guess, friendship, 
                  giving back to the community, being large, professional wrestling. </br>
                  Dislikes: when you take a few more months than you promised 
                  to pay him back, or when you borrow his things without asking.
