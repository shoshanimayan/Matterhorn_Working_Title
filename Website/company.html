              <h2>Team Matterhorn</h2>
              <p>
                While a few of us have experience working with each other,
                this was the first time we as a group of five worked on a
                game together. From the outset, we decided we wanted to 
                push our boundaries and learn the new game engine Godot. 
                Overall, it was an interesting experience, with some parts
                we enjoyed, with other areas we found frustrating.</br>
                That being said, we all were able to continue to grow in
                our desired areas. As a result, everything outside of the
                engine was done in house: original art, original sound,
                original design, AI, and webiste. We had a lot of fun
                on this project.

                    it was fun working with an 8-bit/chiptune sound! </br>

                            Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? 
                            I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. 
                            It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, 
                            so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the 
                            midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the 
                            dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from 
                            dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities 
                            some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only 
                            thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, 
                            of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice 
                            everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his 
                            sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
