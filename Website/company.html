                  Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is John Luke Saake
                  I am currently in my 4th year at the University of California,
                  Irvine studying Computer Game Science with a minor in Innovation
                  and Entrepreneurship. I am looking to continue my career towards
                  game and level design.
                
                  Outside of class, I enjoy playing and learning about games, both 
                  online and board games. I also watch a fair bit of sports, including
                  baseball, hockey, and motor racing.
